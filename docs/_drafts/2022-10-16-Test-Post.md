# Excerpts

You can also manually define an excerpt by using the excerpt_separator field in the YAML:

All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, "Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!" This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.

Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children's minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.

This post has a manual excerpt `<!--more-->` set after the second paragraph. The following YAML Front Matter has also be applied:

```yaml
excerpt_separator: "<!--more-->"

# Text alignment & modification

Sample text to demonstrate alignment and transformation classes.

Easily realign text with alignment classes via HTML:

```
<p class="text-left">Left aligned text.</p>
<p class="text-center">Center aligned text.</p>
<p class="text-right">Right aligned text.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Justified text.</p>
<p class="text-nowrap">No wrap text.</p>
```

Or with Kramdown and [inline attribute lists](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#inline-attribute-lists):

```markdown
Left aligned text.
{: .text-left}

Center aligned text.
{: .text-center}

Right aligned text.
{: .text-right}

Justified text.
{: .text-justify}

No wrap text.
{: .text-nowrap}
```

## Default

This is a paragraph. It should not have any alignment of any kind. It should just flow like you would normally expect. Nothing fancy. Just straight up text, free flowing, with love. Completely neutral and not picking a side or sitting on the fence. It just is. It just freaking is. It likes where it is. It does not feel compelled to pick a side. Leave him be. It will just be better that way. Trust me.

## Left Aligned

This is a paragraph. It is left aligned. Because of this, it is a bit more liberal in it's views. It's favorite color is green. Left align tends to be more eco-friendly, but it provides no concrete evidence that it really is. Even though it likes share the wealth evenly, it leaves the equal distribution up to justified alignment.
{: .text-left}

## Center Aligned

This is a paragraph. It is center aligned. Center is, but nature, a fence sitter. A flip flopper. It has a difficult time making up its mind. It wants to pick a side. Really, it does. It has the best intentions, but it tends to complicate matters more than help. The best you can do is try to win it over and hope for the best. I hear center align does take bribes.
{: .text-center}

## Right Aligned

This is a paragraph. It is right aligned. It is a bit more conservative in it's views. It's prefers to not be told what to do or how to do it. Right align totally owns a slew of guns and loves to head to the range for some practice. Which is cool and all. I mean, it's a pretty good shot from at least four or five football fields away. Dead on. So boss.
{: .text-right}

## Justify Aligned

This is a paragraph. It is justify aligned. It gets really mad when people associate it with Justin Timberlake. Typically, justified is pretty straight laced. It likes everything to be in it's place and not all cattywampus like the rest of the aligns. I am not saying that makes it better than the rest of the aligns, but it does tend to put off more of an elitist attitude.
{: .text-justify}

## No Wrap

This is a paragraph. It has a no wrap. Beef ribs pig tenderloin filet mignon. Spare ribs leberkas ribeye, burgdoggen fatback tenderloin biltong jowl flank sirloin hamburger bacon brisket. Shoulder bresaola drumstick capicola. Beef ribs prosciutto porchetta beef.
{: .text-nowrap}

---

Transform text with capitalization classes via HTML:

```html
<p class="text-lowercase">Lowercased text.</p>
<p class="text-uppercase">Uppercased text.</p>
<p class="text-capitalize">Capitalized text.</p>
<p class="text-truncate">Truncated text.</p>
<p class="small">Small text.</p>
```

Or with Kramdown:

```markdown
Lowercased text
{: .text-lowercase}

Uppercased text
{: .text-uppercase}

Capitalized text
{: .text-capitalize}
```

Lowercased text
{: .text-lowercase}

Uppercased text
{: .text-uppercase}

Capitalized text
{: .text-capitalize}

This is a truncated paragraph of text. Bacon ipsum dolor amet shoulder jowl tail andouille fatback tongue. Ham porchetta kielbasa pork pork chop, tenderloin hamburger meatball. Picanha porchetta swine, brisket salami pork belly burgdoggen. Cupim swine pastrami, chuck tri-tip pork belly jowl shankle alcatra brisket capicola ball tip prosciutto beef ribs doner. Tri-tip bacon ground round pork chop burgdoggen leberkas pork strip steak beef corned beef salami.
{: .text-truncate}

Small text
{: .small}


# Image Alignment

The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let's get started.

Assign classes with HTML:

```html
<img src="image.jpg" class="align-left" alt="">
<img src="image.jpg" class="align-center" alt="">
<img src="image.jpg" class="align-right" alt="">
```

Or use Kramdown and [inline attribute lists](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#inline-attribute-lists):

```markdown
![left-aligned-image](image.jpg){: .align-left}
![center-aligned-image](image.jpg){: .align-center}
![right-aligned-image](image.jpg){: .align-right}
```

![image-center]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/TestPost/image-alignment-580x300.jpg){: .align-center}

The image should be **centered** with the `.align-center` class.

![image-left]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/TestPost/image-alignment-150x150.jpg){: .align-left} The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is **left aligned** with the `.align-left` class.

As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we'll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it's thing. Mission accomplished!

And now for a **massively large image** --- it has **no alignment**.

![no-alignment]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/TestPost/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg)

The image above, though `1200px` wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.

![image-right]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/TestPost/image-alignment-300x200.jpg){: .align-right}

And now we're going to shift things to the **right** with the `.align-right` class. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there --- Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don't care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.

In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah --- Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.

And just when you thought we were done, we're going to do them all over again with captions!

<figure class="align-center">
  <a href="#"><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/posts/TestPost/image-alignment-580x300.jpg" alt=""></a>
  <figcaption>Look at 580 x 300 <a href="#">getting some</a> love.</figcaption>
</figure> 

The figure above happens to be **centered**. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.

<figure style="width: 150px" class="align-left">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/posts/TestPost/image-alignment-150x150.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Itty-bitty caption.</figcaption>
</figure> 

The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is **left aligned** with the `.align-left` class.

As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we'll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it's thing. Mission accomplished!

And now for a massively large image with **no alignment**.

<figure style="width: 1200px">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/posts/TestPost/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Massive image comment for your eyeballs.</figcaption>
</figure> 

The figure element above has an inline style of `width: 1200px` set which should case it to break outside of the normal content flow.

<figure style="width: 300px" class="align-right">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/posts/TestPost/image-alignment-300x200.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Feels good to be on the right.</figcaption>
</figure> 

And now we're going to shift things to the **right** with the `.align-right` class. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there --- Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don't care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.

In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah --- Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.

And that's a wrap, yo! You survived the tumultuous waters of alignment. Image alignment achievement unlocked!

# Syntax Highlighting (also citations)

Syntax highlighting is a feature that displays source code, in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms. This feature facilitates writing in a structured language such as a programming language or a markup language as both structures and syntax errors are visually distinct. Highlighting does not affect the meaning of the text itself; it is intended only for human readers.[^1]

[^1]: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting>

## GFM Code Blocks

GitHub Flavored Markdown [fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/) are supported by default with Jekyll. You may need to update your `_config.yml` file to enable them if you're using an older version.

```yaml
kramdown:
  input: GFM
```

Here's an example of a CSS code snippet written in GFM:

```css
#container {
  float: left;
  margin: 0 -240px 0 0;
  width: 100%;
}
```

Yet another code snippet for demonstration purposes:

```ruby
module Jekyll
  class TagIndex < Page
    def initialize(site, base, dir, tag)
      @site = site
      @base = base
      @dir = dir
      @name = 'index.html'
      self.process(@name)
      self.read_yaml(File.join(base, '_layouts'), 'tag_index.html')
      self.data['tag'] = tag
      tag_title_prefix = site.config['tag_title_prefix'] || 'Tagged: '
      tag_title_suffix = site.config['tag_title_suffix'] || '&#8211;'
      self.data['title'] = "#{tag_title_prefix}#{tag}"
      self.data['description'] = "An archive of posts tagged #{tag}."
    end
  end
end
```

## Jekyll Highlight Liquid Tag

Jekyll also has built-in support for syntax highlighting of code snippets using either Rouge or Pygments, using a dedicated Liquid tag as follows:

```liquid
{% raw %}{% highlight scss %}
.highlight {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 1em;
  font-family: $monospace;
  font-size: $type-size-7;
  line-height: 1.8;
}
{% endhighlight %}{% endraw %}
```

And the output will look like this:

{% highlight scss %}
.highlight {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 1em;
  font-family: $monospace;
  font-size: $type-size-7;
  line-height: 1.8;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's an example of a code snippet using the Liquid tag and `linenos` enabled.

{% highlight html linenos %}
{% raw %}<nav class="pagination" role="navigation">
  {% if page.previous %}
    <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.previous.url }}" class="btn" title="{{ page.previous.title }}">Previous article</a>
  {% endif %}
  {% if page.next %}
    <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.next.url }}" class="btn" title="{{ page.next.title }}">Next article</a>
  {% endif %}
</nav><!-- /.pagination -->{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

## Code Blocks in Lists

Indentation matters. Be sure the indent of the code block aligns with the first non-space character after the list item marker (e.g., `1.`). Usually this will mean indenting 3 spaces instead of 4.

1. Do step 1.
2. Now do this:
   
   ```ruby
   def print_hi(name)
     puts "Hi, #{name}"
   end
   print_hi('Tom')
   #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
   ```
        
3. Now you can do this.

## GitHub Gist Embed

GitHub Gist embeds can also be used:

```html
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mmistakes/77c68fbb07731a456805a7b473f47841.js"></script>
```

Which outputs as:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mmistakes/77c68fbb07731a456805a7b473f47841.js"></script>
